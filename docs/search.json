Apart from this website, the Coe College Tree Archive is also accessible through Stewart Memorial Library’s databases, Coe College’s sustainability page, and of course your favorite search engine. All data and code for the project are available on the archive’s GitHub repository."

    "text": "About the Data\nThis project archives daily forecast data from the National Weather Service. All data come from the National Weather Service’s API. The API’s site contains relevant information and documentation about data available in the repository. To collect forecast data from the National Weather Service’s API, a user must first use the API to find an endpoint URL for a specific (user provided) latitude and longitude. This latitude and longitude is then mapped to the forecasting grid that the National Weather Service uses, and the API returns a URL of the gridpoint associated with the provided latitude and longitude. Then this endpoint URL can be passed back to the API, which returns forecast data.\nUsing the API requires us to choose GPS coordinates that we want forecast data from. To keep this most relevant to policy researchers, I choose to use the GPS coordinates of all US county centroids as well as the GPS coordinates of all US power plants. The forecast data returned is at a subdaily frequency—one observation for the daytime and one observation for the nighttime. I restrict the data to just day-of forecasts, omitting forecasts made, for instance, three days ahead.\nThere are many incredible resources for weather and climate data in the US. Notably, the National Center for Environmental Information provides county-level climate data. Unfortunately these data do not contain potentially relevant fields to policy researchers (e.g., wind speed, wind direction, cloud cover)."

We find that lenders are less willing to originate mortgages and charge higher rates for lower LTV loans that face “un-mapped” flood risk. This effect is weaker for high income applicants, as well as non-banks and small local banks. However, we find evidence that non-banks and local banks are more likely to securitize/sell mortgages to borrowers prone to flood risk. Taken together, our results are indicative that mortgage lenders are aware of flood risk outside FEMA’s identified flood zones.\n\n\n  Other \nCoe College Tree Archive (April 2023)\n\nView Summary\n\n\n\nThe Coe College Tree Archive is an online record of trees on Coe College’s campus.
