I'm a first year PhD student in Environmental Economics at Yale. My research interests are centered around the using tools from industrial organization and financial economics to study issues and energy and resource economics. 
Prior to coming to Yale, I was a research assistant in the Climate Risk Studies group at the New York Fed. I hold a BA in Economics and Math from [Coe College](https://www.coe.edu/), a liberal arts college located in my home state of Iowa.

<p>Using unique nationwide property-level mortgage, flood risk, and flood map data, we analyze whether lenders respond to flood risk that is not captured in FEMA flood maps. We find that lenders are less willing to originate mortgages and charge higher rates for lower LTV loans that face "un-mapped" flood risk. This effect is weaker for high income applicants, as well as non-banks and small local banks. However, we find evidence that non-banks and local banks are more likely to securitize/sell mortgages to borrowers prone to flood risk. Taken together, our results are indicative that mortgage lenders are aware of flood risk outside FEMA's identified flood zones.</p>

<p>The Coe College Tree Archive is an online record of trees on Coe College's campus. By creating an online archive, the project attempts to collect valuable environmental data and promote engagement with Coe's urban forest. The online archive features interactive maps, profiles of Coe's trees, environmental benefit estimates, tips for tree identification, and opportunities to contribute to the archive.</p>
